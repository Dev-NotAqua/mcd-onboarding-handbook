WELCOME TO MARSHALL, CARTER, AND DARKE LTD.!

Are you a decently newer fella to custom site RP?
Confused on what to do now that you have passed into MC&D?
Need general assistance?

Fear not‚Ä¶ this document was crafted just to help you progress and settle down with our company.
-------------------------------------------------------------
Verify:
You have just joined the MC&D official Discord server, but you have access to barely any channels!

How can you fix this? Verify! Our server has a bot named ‚ÄúBloxlink‚Äù which enables you to verify and obtain the ‚Äúverified‚Äù role. All you have to do is run the command ‚Äú/verify‚Äù in the following channel.

You should now have obtained the ‚Äúverified‚Äù role and have access to the following channels if not more!

-------------------------------------------------------------
Codenames:
Well now you have access to a whole bunch of new channels, what is next? Here at MC&D, and all other factions/departments throughout custom site RP, you‚Äôll need a codename. Try and think of a unique, appropriate, and favorable codename you‚Äôd like to be referred to as by your MC&D comrades. Then, proceed to the following channel and read pinned messages. You should be able to find a codename request format. Here is that same format below if you cannot find it.


FORMAT:
Discord Username: 
Roblox Username: 
Codename Request: 

NOTE: Your codename must be approved by HICOM+ to proceed to make a morph

You will be given the following roles shortly after your codename is requested, remain patient.


- ‚Äú[:] MC&D Shareholders [:]‚Äù
- ‚Äú[:] Low Rank [:]‚Äù
- ‚Äú[:] Recruit [:]‚Äù
- ‚Äú[:] Wrecker Division [:]
- ‚Äú[:] Current Generation [:]‚Äù
-------------------------------------------------------------
Morphs:
We are getting to a little more complex step of settling into factions, morphs. Hopefully you are competent enough to understand the process. Morphs are the way you represent your faction while on-site, and deploy. Let me show you how to make your morph, and also how to get morphed on-site. This process revolves around the following two channels.

Step 1: Take the LR Morph format from morph-formats and copy it

Step 2: Create a post in morphs-locker and name it after your codename (in ‚Äú‚Äùs)
Step 3: Paste the LR Morph format into the post details (DON‚ÄôT SUBMIT YET!)
Step 4: Change every ‚Äúuser‚Äù in the block of text, to your Roblox Username
Step 5: Change ‚ÄúRank‚Äù in the :permrtag command to Recruit

Step 6: Change ‚ÄúCodename‚Äù in the :permntag command to your accepted codename

Step 7: Submit the locker post, await a HICOM+ to stamp the ‚ÄúApproved‚Äù tag

Now how exactly do you get morphed on-site? Well, MC&D does grant mod perms to HR+, so if you see an HR+ online then they can morph you if they have received perms yet. If there is no HR+ on-site, then you have no choice but to resort to getting a morpher. How do we get one? Go to Site 64‚Äôs main server and find the following channel.

Once you have reached this channel, copy and paste your morph in your locker and say ‚Äú!morpher‚Äù in the in-game communications radio. Soon enough, with patience a member of the GMT (Game Moderation Team) or a different staff member, will teleport to you and use the morph you sent in the morphs channel, and they will morph you so you are ready to self deploy!
-------------------------------------------------------------
Self Deploying and Points:
How can you log a shift? This section will revolve around two channels once again, and will focus on how to run a self deployment and also request points for that hard work.

First, create a post designated for yourself in the shift-logs channel. Name it with your codename in ‚Äú‚Äùs. The format to use for every single log in your own post, is in the pinned post of the shift-logs channel, but also below:

FORMAT:
Codename: 
Current Rank: 
Division: 
Time: 
Tasks/Notes: 
Proof: (1+ Screenshots w/ Trident Timer)

Your Trident Timer can be begun in your shift-log post, using the command /shift manage command. The bot will allow you to begin your shift, and if the command is run again, give you the option to pause and take a break or end the shift. Handy right? This is what your shift will look like after you end it (ignore the 3 seconds üò≠).

Be sure to remain productive throughout your shifts; live up to MC&D‚Äôs purpose and reputation! Keep in mind, shifts do not include time spent in an official deployment, only time spent alone. USe the ‚Äúbreak‚Äù feature of the bot to solve that.

Once you have logged your shift, it is time to request points for that shift. Head over to the point-request channel, and use the format in pinned messages over there. If not found, it is listed below.

FORMAT:
Username:
Division:
Rank:
Points Requested:
Shift Log Link:
Ping:

Be sure to read pinned chats for rules of this complex channel as well! Note that for the shift log link, you must provide the EXACT shift log message within your individual shift post so those who are giving you points, can click on the link and head straight to the log. Find the following button when holding shift and your cursor is above your log message.

Once the individual message link is copied you may add it for your Shift Log Link in the format.
-------------------------------------------------------------
Promotions:
You‚Äôve got points, but look at that behemoth of a list of ranks in hierarchy-and-points!

Well, in the next channel, the promotion-request channel, you can request promotions! Once again, it is as simple as a format to request a promotion. The format is in the pinned chats, but once again, if not found, then see the format listed below.


FORMAT:

Username:
Division:
Rank:
Current Points:
Rank Request:
Ping:

Perfect! You now know how to be promoted! Let‚Äôs get to the things you can explore around the server.
-------------------------------------------------------------
Beginner Information:
There are various channels all packed in one category ([:] INFORMATION [:]), that are useful to read to figure out more about MC&D‚Äôs purpose, punishment systems, goals you can have during your stay at the company, and more! Here are the following channels, be sure to take a look at all of them to get the jist of what was said earlier.

The default division of MC&D is the Wrecker Division, as it is the only division LRs may join; but you can always attempt to expand your output to our other division, the Accounting Division [once you are an MR+]. The divisional advertisements are found here:

Learn cool stuff and ditch school because MC&D is your school!

Read up on recent announcements that may apply to you!

Have a laugh and look at our ‚Äúhall of shame‚Äù!

Please do not hesitate and feel free to ask questions!!!

I would say about now is when you know 75% of what you need to settle down here in MC&D. The rest can be found in things like the MC&D Handbook (found in our advertisement and underneath rules), and a few other documents. Thanks for willing to try out and participate in MC&D, we hope you make an impact on the capitalist cause!
