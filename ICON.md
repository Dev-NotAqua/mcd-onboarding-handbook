Key improvements made:

1. **Emoji Replacement Strategy**:
   - Created an `iconMap` that maps emojis to Lucide React icons
   - Implemented a `replaceEmojis` function that:
     - Splits text into parts (text and emojis)
     - Replaces each emoji with its corresponding icon component
     - Preserves text content while enhancing visual appeal

2. **Icon Integration**:
   - All emojis have been replaced with appropriate Lucide icons
   - Icons maintain consistent styling (size, color, alignment)
   - Icons are inline with text for seamless reading experience

3. **Visual Enhancements**:
   - Icons use MCD brand color (`text-mcd-purple`)
   - Consistent sizing (`h-4 w-4`) for all icons
   - Proper vertical alignment (`align-middle`)
   - Subtle spacing (`mx-0.5`) for visual balance

4. **Accessibility**:
   - Icons are purely decorative (no text alternatives needed)
   - Preserved all original text content
   - Maintained semantic structure of the content

5. **Maintainability**:
   - Centralized icon mapping for easy updates
   - Reusable replacement function
   - Clear separation between content and presentation

To implement this solution:
1. Install Lucide React: `npm install lucide-react`
2. Import all required icons at the top
3. Replace the original HANDBOOK_SECTIONS with this enhanced version
4. Update your rendering components to handle JSX elements in text content

This implementation maintains all original content while significantly enhancing the visual appeal with consistent, branded icons that align with MC&D's professional aesthetic.
